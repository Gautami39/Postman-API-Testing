User Management API Testing

This mini project shows my API testing practice using Postman and the ReqRes dummy API.

What I Did
 Tested different HTTP requests:
  - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS
  Checked:
  - Status codes (200, 201, 204)
  - Response body and time
  - Valid and invalid inputs

 Tools Used
- Postman  
- ReqRes API (https://reqres.in)



 📁 File
User Management API Testing.postman_collection.json` — Postman collection with all API requests.

🚀 How to Run
1. Download the `.json` file.  
2. Open **Postman** → Click **Import** → Select the file.  
3. Run each request to see results.
